## How to Delegate to FirstBlock Ventures
Delegating to our validator is done using three commands which connect to a full node, setup your connection and execute the delegation: 

1) <code>gaiacli config node INSERTNODEHERE</code>

2) <code>gaiacli config trust-node false</code>

3) <code>gaiacli tx staking delegate cosmosvaloper1hjct6q7npsspsg3dgvzk3sdf89spmlpfdn6m9d 100000000000uatom --from myKeyName --gas auto --gas-prices 1uatom --chain-id cosmoshub-1</code>

## Our Validator
Leveraging our own experience and that of our partners and advisors, we are able to provide the next level of enterprise cloud infrastructure experience to the table in order to develop architecture that allow us to automatically scale in heavy load environments, processes for real-time monitoring and automated deployment across diverse geographies.

## To the Cosmos Community
We would like to thank the Cosmos team and community who have helped make this happen. FirstBlock Ventures was thrilled to participate in several testnets before entering the Game of Stakes where we received an allocation from the ICF based on our performance.  We are excited to take this journey with you all as Cosmos tackles interoperability, scalability and providing a developer friendly environment to grow the ecosystem.

## Your Delegation & Risks
As supporters of the Cosmos ecosystem, it is your choice to delegate to validators you see potential in. We hope to earn your delegation through our actions, reliability and transparency. Before delegating, please always understand the risks associated with doing so, as detailed in the [Cosmos.network documentation](https://cosmos.network/docs/resources/delegator-faq.html#risks).
