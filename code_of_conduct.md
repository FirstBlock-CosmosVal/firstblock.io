The commitments we make within this code of conduct apply to all FirstBlock Ventures LLC employees, as well as all of our projects and endeavors as block producers and developers for the EOS blockchain. All statements within this code of conduct have been personally approved by the proprietors of FirstBlock Ventures LLC.  However, these commitments are not to be conflated with a legally binding contract and are subject to change.
## Reliability Of Infrastructure
FirstBlock Ventures LLC prides itself on offering a reliable network validator and other services for the Cosmos community. We have strategically built an infrastructure that is reliable even when facing regional outages or localized attacks. Should this model ever prove unreliable, we are committed to changing and adapting our system to resolve the issue.
## Products and Services
We strive to create products and offer services for the Cosmos ecosystem that are reliable and address demonstrable needs and desires from the community. With a team of talented and experienced developers, you can rest assured that anything created by FirstBlock Ventures LLC is high-quality, safe to use, and reliable. In addition to creating tools that enhance all users’ blockchain experience, we pledge to release updates whenever necessary to make sure that our products not only start out as reliable, but remain reliable over time.

## Engagement Of FirstBlock Ventures LLC with the Cosmos Community
FirstBlock Ventures LLC pledges to always remain an active and responsible member of the Cosmos community. We commit to actively listening and engaging with the community, so that we can understand the thoughts and concerns of users. When any member of the FirstBlock Ventures LLC team speaks to a member of the Cosmos community, they will be respectful, truthful and transparent, and will answer all questions to the best of their abilities.
We will take these conversations into account when developing new projects. Not only that, but we encourage community members to help us develop our projects too; all of our products are and will be open source, and we welcome additions and improvements from independent developers.
## Of the Cosmos Community with Cosmos Governance
One of the guiding ideas at FirstBlock Ventures LLC is that for a blockchain to be successful, it must have an active and well-informed community behind it. We believe in empowering token-holders to directly participate in blockchain governance.
