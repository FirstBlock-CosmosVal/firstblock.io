<br/>
Everything we do is informed by our core values of Trust, Reliability and Security.  The commitments we make within this code of conduct apply to all of our projects and ventures as validators and developers. However, these commitments are not a legally binding contract and are subject to change.

## Reliability 
Our goal is to provide a reliable network validator and other services for the ecosystems we support, and the greater crypto community at large. We have  built an infrastructure that is reliable even when facing regional outages or localized attacks. Should this model ever prove unreliable, we are committed to changing and adapting our system to resolve the issue.

## Public Disclosures
We are committed to the transparency and accuracy of our operations and public communications. 

## Ethics
We are committed to act with honesty and integrity while ensuring the highest ethical standards in all aspects of our conduct. 

## Financial Transparency
We will maintain full financial and operational control at all times. No outside investors or strategic partners will own more than 15% ownership stake nor shall any owners or partners hold a vested interest in other Validators.

## Services
We will create and offer services for the ecosystems we support that are reliable and address needs from the community. 

## Engagement
We are committed to actively listening to the community, so that we can create actionable tasks to better serve them.
